                            Hello World! I was just born. I am the youngest entry. I also have the largest Version number.
                            Younger entries will be placed above older ones. I am a prime example. The entry below me
                            is older than me.

                            Our group seems to agree on the theme of an arcade-style sidescrolling game (possibly a fighter,
                            more likely a beat-em-up). We aren't sure yet whether our character should be able to move in 4 directions
                            or 8 directions, given that 8 directions seems more difficult and requires more sprites. I'm convinced,
                            however, that with the style of game, we should be able to pull off 8 directional movement with 4 directions
                            of sprites (the best of both worlds!).
