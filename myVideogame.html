            <p>This the project I'm working on in my videogame programming class.
                It's an RPG game that focuses on turn-based combat. It's coded in 
                Java via Eclipse IDE.

                        Hello World! I was just born. I am the youngest entry. I also have the largest Version number.
                        Younger entries will be placed above older ones. I am a prime example. The entry below me
                        is older than me.

                    <p id = "logContent">At this stage, the videogame is merely a collection of thoughts and ideas.
                        One of my main inspirations is <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/913740/WORLD_OF_HORROR/">World of Horror</a>.
                        Another is the <a href = "https://www.pokemon.com/us">Pok√©mon</a> franchise. I'm not certain whether I want my
                        character to be able to roam around, or if I want the interface to be click-based. I'm only certain that I will focus
                        on a turn-based combat system similar to the videogames that inspire me. So far, I'm only able to create and manipulate
                        some rectangles in a Jframe window. I will return with more when I'm farther along the idea, learning, and development 
                        process.
